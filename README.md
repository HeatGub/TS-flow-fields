# Flow fields experiments - TypeScript
This code is mainly the one you can find under source links (with minor changes), but rewritten from JavaScript to TypeScript. Made for coding practise and enjoyment.

# Overwiew
- Canvas is divided into grid's cells, which make a vector field. The field influences the direction of particle's movement by according vector value.  Particle's movement is also influnced by the text/image color, which enables interesting flow directions using text color gradient.
- Oject oriented code, many drawing parameters
- Checkout previous commits to review this code, as commits follow video chapters.
